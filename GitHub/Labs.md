# Fork a Repo
A **fork** is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
## About Forks
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository. For more information, see [Working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)
## Propose Changes to Project
For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a pull request to the project owner.
## Forking a Repository
You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same *octocat/Spoon-Knife* repository you just forked.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
## Cloning the Forked Repository
Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

1. On 'GitHub.com', navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.
2. Above the list of files, click **Code**.
